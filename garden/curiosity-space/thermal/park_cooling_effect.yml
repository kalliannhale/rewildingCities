# The core curiosity
question: "How effectively do urban parks cool their surroundings?"

description: >
  Urban parks create localized cooling islands within the heat of cities. 
  Trees transpire, water evaporates, shade blocks radiation, and green 
  surfaces absorb less heat than concrete. But how far does this cooling 
  extend? How strong is it? And what makes some parks better thermal 
  refuges than others?
  
  This curiosity drives us toward understanding parks not just as 
  recreational spaces, but as critical cooling infrastructure—nature's 
  air conditioning in an overheating world.

# Why this matters
significance: >
  Urban heatwaves have become the deadliest of natural disasters. As 
  cities warm, understanding and maximizing the cooling potential of 
  green infrastructure becomes a matter of public health, environmental 
  justice, and climate resilience. Parks in low-income neighborhoods 
  are often smaller and less vegetated—quantifying cooling effects 
  helps advocate for equitable green space distribution.

# The sub-questions we can explore
sub_questions:

  maximum_cooling:
    question: "What is the peak cooling effect at the park boundary?"
    description: >
      The strongest temperature difference between inside and outside 
      the park's thermal influence zone. This is the "best case" cooling 
      a person might experience.
    interpretation: >
      Higher values indicate parks that create sharp thermal gradients—
      stepping into their influence zone feels dramatically cooler. 
      Think of it as the park's "thermal welcome mat."
    answers_for:
      - Pedestrian thermal comfort assessment
      - Identifying strongest thermal refuges
      - Heat vulnerability mapping

  cumulative_cooling:
    question: "What is the total cooling contribution across the influence zone?"
    description: >
      The average temperature reduction from park edge to the boundary 
      of influence. Captures sustained cooling rather than peak cooling.
    interpretation: >
      Higher values indicate parks that provide consistent cooling over 
      distance, even if the peak isn't dramatic. Better for modeling 
      aggregate urban heat reduction.
    answers_for:
      - Urban heat island modeling
      - Infrastructure thermal load calculations
      - City-wide cooling capacity assessment

  cooling_extent:
    question: "How far does the cooling effect extend?"
    description: >
      The distance at which park influence becomes indistinguishable 
      from background urban temperature—the "turning point."
    interpretation: >
      Larger extent means the park benefits a wider area. A small park 
      with large extent punches above its weight. Extent may vary by 
      direction based on wind patterns and surrounding land cover.
    answers_for:
      - Buffer zone planning around parks
      - Spacing recommendations for new green spaces
      - Understanding park "reach"

  cooling_factors:
    question: "What landscape features most influence cooling intensity?"
    description: >
      The relationship between park characteristics (area, shape, 
      vegetation density, water presence) and cooling performance.
    interpretation: >
      Identifies actionable design parameters. If vegetation density 
      correlates more strongly than area, then improving existing parks 
      may be more effective than building new ones.
    depends_on: 
      - maximum_cooling
      - cumulative_cooling
    answers_for:
      - Park design guidelines
      - Prioritizing improvement investments
      - Understanding mechanism of cooling

  surrounding_influence:
    question: "How does the surrounding urban environment affect cooling?"
    description: >
      Whether parks in dense commercial areas perform differently than 
      parks in residential neighborhoods. The role of impervious surfaces, 
      building height, traffic, and nighttime lights.
    interpretation: >
      Parks don't exist in isolation. A park surrounded by asphalt may 
      show strong cooling (because the baseline is so hot) or weak cooling 
      (because the surrounding heat overwhelms it). Understanding this 
      helps site new parks strategically.
