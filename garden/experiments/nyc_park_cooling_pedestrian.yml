name: "NYC Park Cooling Analysis: Pedestrian Thermal Comfort"

description: >
  How effectively do New York City's parks cool their surroundings, 
  and which parks offer the strongest thermal refuge for pedestrians?
  
  This inquiry applies buffer gradient analysis to 2,000+ NYC parks 
  using summer Landsat LST imagery, measuring the peak cooling effect 
  (TPM-M) using median temperatures to represent the typical experience 
  of a person walking through each park's influence zone.

# What question are we answering?
curiosity: 
  ref: $curiosity-space/thermal/park_cooling_effect
  sub_question: maximum_cooling

# What method are we using?
method: 
  ref: $methods/thermal/buffer_gradient_analysis

# What choices are we making?
choices:
  intensity_measure: TPM-M
  central_tendency: median
  buffer_interval: 30
  max_buffer_distance: 300

# Why these choices?
rationale: >
  We're interested in pedestrian thermal comfort—the "felt" difference 
  when entering a park's cooling zone. 
  
  **TPM-M** captures the peak cooling at the boundary, representing 
  the strongest relief a pedestrian would experience.
  
  **Median LST** is robust to anomalous hot surfaces (parking lots, 
  maintenance buildings, paved paths) that don't represent the typical 
  thermal experience within or around the park.
  
  **30m intervals** match our Landsat LST resolution.
  
  **300m max distance** is sufficient for most NYC parks based on 
  literature suggesting urban park cooling rarely extends beyond 
  this distance.

# Where are we applying this?
city: nyc
manifest: plots/nyc/manifest.yml

# Parameters specific to this inquiry
parameters:
  min_park_area_ha: 0.09
  min_park_area_rationale: >
    Following Xiao et al. (2023), exclude parks smaller than 0.09 
    hectares as they may not generate measurable cooling signatures 
    at Landsat resolution.
  
  lst_season: summer
  lst_season_rationale: >
    Summer captures peak heat stress when park cooling is most 
    critical for public health.
  
  target_crs: "EPSG:2263"
  target_crs_rationale: >
    New York State Plane (Long Island), feet. Standard CRS for 
    NYC municipal data, ensures accurate area and distance calculations.

# How to interpret results
interpretation_guidance: >
  **PCI values** represent the maximum cooling effect in degrees Celsius.
  A PCI of 5.0 means the park creates up to 5°C of cooling at its 
  influence boundary compared to inside the park.
  
  **Higher PCI** = stronger thermal refuge. But consider context:
  - Parks in dense commercial areas may show high PCI simply because 
    surroundings are extremely hot
  - Parks surrounded by other green space may show low PCI because 
    the baseline is already cool
  
  **Turning point distance** indicates how far the cooling extends.
  A small park with large extent is punching above its weight.
  
  **For pedestrian comfort**: prioritize parks with high PCI and 
  accessible entrances from heat-stressed areas.

# Limitations to document
limitations:
  - "Single-season analysis may not represent year-round patterns"
  - "Landsat 30m resolution may miss fine-scale thermal variations"
  - "Does not account for vertical thermal gradients (shade vs. sun)"
  - "Buffer zones may cross into other parks or water bodies"
  - "Wind direction affects cooling plume but is not modeled here"
