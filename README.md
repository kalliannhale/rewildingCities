# rewildingCities 🌱

*Collective science for climate-resilient futures.*

Authors of science fiction interpret our realities to imagine and project our shared histories, futures, global maps, and economies. We're building tools to investigate these speculative realities, together.

rewildingCities is an open-source platform for collective imagination through actual science—where research on urban ecosystems meets worldbuilding, and data becomes a lens for designing climate-resilient futures. We create accessible, rigorous analytical tools for communities ready to ask: *How will we redraw this map? What flourishes when we make room for the wild? When will we finally design our infrastructure like nature does—to be collaborative, adaptive, regenerative?*

**Our first investigation: surviving rising temperatures.** We're going to need to understand how heat travels throughout our cities. Nature did it best with green infrastructure, and we want to look at how we can design a *literal* rewilding of the city to combat our deadliest, most frequent natural disasters: heat waves. We've built an accessible pipeline for citizens to conduct their own geospatial analyses with community-specific datasets.

Currently, our platform supports initial spatial analyses exploring rising urban temperatures and the effects of green infrastructure. We invite researchers, organizers, and learners to build with us—creating pipelines using this infrastructure to investigate the questions that matter to your community, and contribute to the development of economies of resilience.

## Who is this for?

- **Researchers and analysts** who believe data can serve more than dashboards
- **Advocates and planners** building evidence for climate-resilient futures
- **Designers and systems thinkers** practicing biomimicry at the civic scale
- **Learners** developing technical literacy through meaningful work

## Our Garden 🌿

The codebase is organized as a garden—a living system where patterns emerge from interaction:

| Directory | Purpose | Metaphor |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `soil/` | Validation, repair, data registration | Preparing the ground |
| `seeds/` | Schemas, crosswalks, templates | Preserved patterns |
| `roots/` | Primitives (atomic analytical operations) | Hidden foundation |
| `growth/` | Recipes (composed workflows) | What blooms |
| `harvest/` | Outputs (reports, maps, dashboards) | What we gather |
| `compost/` | Logs, archives, feedback | Transformation |
| `garden/` | Experiments, notebooks, tests | Where new things grow |
| `plots/` | City-specific data and manifests | Each city is a plot |
| `field-guide/` | Documentation | Nature guide |
| `canopy/` | Orchestration | Visible structure |

---

## How is this shaped?

**Manifests** declare what data a city has—not just formats, but meaning. What does this dataset represent? What are its limitations? What story can it tell?

**Recipes** compose analytical workflows from atomic primitives. Run them for learning. Run them for production. The same tools serve both.

**Profiles** let you subset for context: `dev` for fast iteration, `full` for production, `neighborhood` for local analysis.

**Crosswalks** translate between classification systems, because every city names its world differently.

---

## Our guiding principles:

1. **Honest outputs** — Document limitations. Tell people what they're actually getting.
2. **Data pluralism** — Help communities work with what they have.
3. **Composable primitives** — Atomic operations for learning or production.
4. **Transparent provenance** — Every output knows where it came from.
5. **Local-first, cloud-ready** — Works on a laptop. Scales when needed.
6. **Pedagogical design** — The structure teaches.

## The vision:

rewildingCities is a project of **Rewilding Intelligence**, a research initiative facilitating collaborative data science for climate-resilient futures. Infrastructure for investigating urban ecosystems. Tools that meet communities where they are. Research that learns from the patterns our natural environment has made clear.
